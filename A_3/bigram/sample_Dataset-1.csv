3,"in a web application there could be two approaches to mitigate xss attacks: all the input data could be filtered (removing all 'bad' data), or the input could be parsed, tokenized and output with only the allowed tags etcwhich method should be preferred from security standpoint? with either method, what are the gotchas?user input data, is filtering enough or should it be parsed?"
4,"i have a php application that i would like to have audited for security. i'm familiar with most of the general security issues, but want to make sure i didn't miss anything. what steps should i take to perform a self-audit? what tools are available? what is the best way to find a 3rd-party auditor? any recommendations?interested in both whitebox/codereview audit and blackbox/pentest?how to perform a security audit for a php application?"
