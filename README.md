The problem of finding similarity score among all document set having pair of sentences and
how Vector space can be used to solve it. A vector space is a mathematical structure formed
by a collection of elements called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied
("scaled") by numbers, called scalars in this context. A document is a bag of words or a
collection of words or terms. The problem can be easily experienced in the domain of web
search or classification, where the aim is to find out documents which are similar in context
or content.
Measuring semantic nearness of documents is important for accurate information retrieval,
automated text categorization and classification. Inspired by the observation that text
documents contain semantically coherent set of ideas/topics, this paper presents the design
and experimental evaluation of a method to represent a text document as a set of concepts.
Based on this, we propose a method to measure semantic nearness of texts. Our method
makes use of Python3.1 with different packages. In order to show the effectiveness of our
representation of texts, we compare experimental results of text classification and clustering
with the results of classification and clustering with standard techniques.
We identified top words (or phrases) from a collection and represented each document as a
vector in the vector space determined by those top words. After that we found similarities
between documents in that vector space. Finally, we implemented on the given dataset
having pair of sentences and produced output as score similarity among those document
set.
